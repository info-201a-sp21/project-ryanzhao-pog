# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

## Domain of Interest:

We are interested in the domain of public/global health. We chose this domain because one of our members is a public health major, and we also feel like the data that we interact with can be displayed in an impactful and meaningful way. We also feel like there are a lot of different directions that we can go with this domain, and it is extremely relevant to our lives after the COVID-19 pandemic that has had such an huge impact on the whole world.

### Data Driven Projects:

One data driven project that we found was a dataset tracking community transmission of Covid-19 cases in the United States at a county level.

We found this data driven project about general world health statistics that offers a visual summary for a variety of global health topics.

The third data driven project we found was a dataset about cancer statistics split up by U.S. states.

#### Some questions that we hope to answer about public/global health are:

- What region of the United States are you more likely to have caught Covid?
- What state has the highest cancer rate?
- Which country's are most susceptible to diseases or health problems?
