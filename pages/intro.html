      <h1>Purpose and Importance of Our Project</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of our project is to view the extent of treatment coverage for HIV/AIDS in
        countries globally and ART treatment's impact on the number of people living with HIV and compare
        the amount of people living with HIV by region.

      <h2>Source of Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The data was collected and generated by WHO and UNESCO from their public records
        on the number of people living with HIV/AIDS around the world. Devakumar cleaned
        that data from WHO and UNESCO and put the data into a CSV file that draws a focus
        on treatment statistics for those living with HIV/AIDS by country.
